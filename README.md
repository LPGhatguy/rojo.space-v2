# rojo.space v2
Work-in-progress rewrite of [rojo.space](https://rojo.space) to drop Gatsby and MkDocs in favor of a single solution. Builds upon [parcel-ssg-example](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/parcel-ssg-example), an experiment I ran to see if building an ad hoc SSG was feasible. It is!

## Requirements
- Node.js 12.x

## Usage
As always, install dependencies first:

```bash
npm install
```

To run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build to the `dist/` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```
